 IMPORTANT NOTE: using bcrypt doesn't mean hackers wouldn't be
    able to figure out the password from hashes through brute force
    attack or something like that but it would provide some level of
    protection and give you time to let your users know about the 
    data bridge so that they can change their own password if they 
    need to
